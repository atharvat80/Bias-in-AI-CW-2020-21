For the Bias in AI sub-module we had to implement an AI solution with a real world application which does not discriminate based on the chosen human centric attributes of the data. 
For this assignment I used the "Adult Census Income" dataset to implement a classifier which can be used for recruiting which does not discriminate individuals on their race or sex. More details can be found in `report.pdf`.
